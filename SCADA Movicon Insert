I have my vibration 10 vibration sensors. I need to monitor it and collect data value from sensors into SQL Server. I using Movicon SCADA so can I use Movicon to run VBS that insert query to SQL Server?
Yes, it is possible to use VBS scripts to insert data into a SQL Server database when using the Movicon SCADA software. Movicon supports the use of VBScript for programming custom logic and interactions, so you can use VBScript to create a script that retrieves data from your vibration sensors and inserts it into a SQL Server database using a SQL INSERT query.
You should be able to run the script within Movicon by using a VBS script Action and trigger it based on your requirements.
It's also a good idea to validate and check the data read from sensors before inserting it to the Database to avoid any unexpected results.

Please be advised that, I am not familiar with the exact format of Movicon SCADA, and I recommend checking the software's documentation or consulting with a Movicon SCADA expert for more detailed instructions on how to accomplish this task.

So How to create a VBScript in Movicon. I also need my script activate every 1 second
In Movicon, you can create a VBScript by using the built-in VBScript editor, which can be accessed through the Project Editor. Once you have the editor open, you can create a new script by clicking on the "New" button or by right-clicking in the editor window and selecting "New Script".

To activate the script every 1 second, you can use the "Timer" object in VBScript. This object provides a way to execute a script at specified intervals. Here is an example of how you might use the Timer object in your script:

Copy code
Dim oTimer
Set oTimer = Timer.New(1000) 'create a new timer with an interval of 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
oTimer.OnElapsed = "InsertDataToSQL" 'set the name of the function to be executed when the timer elapses
oTimer.Enabled = True 'enable the timer
This code will create a new Timer object with an interval of 1000 milliseconds (1 second), and set the function "InsertDataToSQL" to be executed when the timer elapses. The timer is then enabled, so it will start running as soon as the script is executed.

Here is an example of a sample function that could be called by the Timer object in order to execute your SQL Insert statement:

Copy code
Sub InsertDataToSQL()
   ' Code to Retrieve data from sensors
   ' Validate the data
   ' Create a Connection to SQL Server
   ' Execute SQL Insert statement with the data
End Sub
As you can see the function should handle the collection, validation and insertion of the data, you can use ADODB library that is built in VBScript to create a connection and execute the SQL statement.
Please be aware that this is just a general example and may need to be modified to work with the specifics of your system and data structure

I suggest checking the Movicon SCADA documentation and consulting with a Movicon SCADA expert for more detailed instructions on how to accomplish this task and using VBScript in Movicon SCADA.

How to read/write runtime tags in Movicon VBScript 
In Movicon, you can read and write the values of runtime tags in a VBScript using the "Tag" object. The Tag object provides properties and methods for interacting with the tags in your project.

To read the value of a tag, you can use the "Value" property of the Tag object. Here is an example of how you might read the value of a tag named "MyTag" in a VBScript:

Copy code
Dim tagValue
tagValue = Tag("MyTag").Value
This will assign the current value of the tag "MyTag" to the variable "tagValue".

To write a new value to a tag, you can use the "Value" property along with the assignment operator "=". Here is an example of how you might write a new value to a tag named "MyTag" in a VBScript:

Copy code
Tag("MyTag").Value = newValue
This will set the value of the tag "MyTag" to the variable "newValue".

You can also check the type of a tag by using the "DataType" property.

Copy code
Dim TagType
TagType = Tag("MyTag").DataType
Please note that, the Tag object is available only inside the script Action, it will not be available on the global scope of the project. Also, make sure that the tags that you want to read or write from VBScript should exist in the project before trying to read or write them.

It's a good practice to do error handling when working with tags and make sure the tags that you want to read or write are available and accessible during the run time.
I suggest checking the Movicon SCADA documentation and consulting with a Movicon SCADA expert for more detailed instructions on how to accomplish this task and using VBScript in Movicon SCADA.

How to mapping MyTag that you show previousy with a sensor data value
In Movicon, you can map a tag with a sensor data value by using the "Tag" object along with the input or output modules of the sensor.

Here's an example of how you might map a tag named "MyTag" with a sensor data value in a VBScript:

Copy code
'Retrieve sensor data
dim sensorData
sensorData = InputModule("MySensor").Read()

'Map the sensor data to the tag
Tag("MyTag").Value = sensorData
This script would first retrieve the sensor data using the "InputModule" object and the "Read" method, which reads the current value of the sensor connected to the input module "MySensor". The sensor data is then assigned to the "sensorData" variable.
Then the sensorData will be written to the "MyTag" by using Tag object as I have shown you before.

It is also important to note that some sensor may require special libraries or drivers to be connected to the Scada system and maybe the above example is not the exact way to retrieve data from your sensor, I suggest checking the sensor documentation and the Movicon SCADA documentation for more information.

Please note that, In this example I am assuming that the sensor is connected to the Input Module, if the sensor is connected to an output module, you should use the OutputModule instead of InputModule.
It's a good practice to do error handling when working with tags and make sure the tags that you want to read or write are available and accessible during the run time and also the sensor is properly connected and configured.

Then about the VBScript I need a script that collect my 10 sensors insert it to SQL Server at same time oh please sent datetime also
Here is an example of a VBScript that collects data from 10 sensors, validates the data, and then inserts the data along with a timestamp into a SQL Server database:

Copy code
' Declare variables
dim sensorData(1 to 10), conn, cmd, sql, timestamp

' Retrieve sensor data
For i = 1 To 10
   sensorData(i) = InputModule("Sensor" & i).Read()
   'Validate the data if it is in the expected range
   If sensorData(i) < 0 or sensorData(i) > 100 Then
       sensorData(i) = 0 ' or whatever value you want to use for invalid data
   End If
Next

' Get current timestamp
timestamp = Now()

' Create ADODB connection
Set conn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")

' Open connection to the SQL Server
conn.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=<server_name>;Initial Catalog=<database_name>;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>"

' Create ADODB command
Set cmd = CreateObject("ADODB.Command")

' Assign the connection to the command
Set cmd.ActiveConnection = conn

' Construct SQL INSERT statement
sql = "INSERT INTO Sensors (Timestamp, Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5, Sensor6, Sensor7, Sensor8, Sensor9, Sensor10) VALUES ('" & timestamp & "', " & sensorData(1) & ", " & sensorData(2) & ", " & sensorData(3) & ", " & sensorData(4) & ", " & sensorData(5) & ", " & sensorData(6) & ", " & sensorData(7) & ", " & sensorData(8) & ", " & sensorData(9) & ", " & sensorData(10) & ")"

' Assign the SQL statement to the command
cmd.CommandText = sql

' Execute the command
cmd.Execute

' Close the connection
conn.Close

' Release ADODB objects
Set cmd = Nothing
Set conn = Nothing
This script uses the "InputModule" object to retrieve the data from 10 sensors, it also validates the data to make sure it falls within a certain range. If it does not fall within the range, you can assign the value to zero or any other value that you want to use for invalid data.
Then it retrieves the current timestamp using the VBScript's "Now()" function.
It also creates an ADODB connection to the SQL Server and open it by providing the connection details. After that, it uses an ADODB Command object to construct an SQL INSERT statement with all the sensor data and the timestamp, and then execute the SQL command. Finally, it closes the connection and release the ADODB objects.

Please note that the script above is just an example, and you will need to adjust it to work with your specific SQL Server and table structure, also you should use parameters instead of hard-coding values in the SQL statement to avoid SQL Injection.
It's a good practice to check the return value of the execute statement and also do error handling when working with SQL Server and ADODB.

can vbs use `${MyTags} ` to concat string like Javascript
No, VBScript does not support template literals like JavaScript's ${...} syntax. Instead, VBScript uses the concatenation operator & to concatenate strings.
Here is an example of how you might use the concatenation operator to concatenate a string with the value of a tag named "MyTag" in a VBScript:

Copy code
dim myString, tagValue
myString = "The value of MyTag is: "
tagValue = Tag("MyTag").Value
myString = myString & tagValue
You can also use the built-in function "CStr" to convert a variable value to a string before concatenating it:

Copy code
dim myString, tagValue
myString = "The value of MyTag is: "
tagValue = Tag("MyTag").Value
myString = myString & CStr(tagValue)
Also there are other string manipulation functions such as "Format" that allow you to create a string with placeholders and insert variables into them

Copy code
dim myString, tagValue
tagValue = Tag("MyTag").Value
myString = Format("The value of MyTag is: {0}", tagValue)
It's a good practice to check the data type of the tag before using it and if necessary convert it to string to avoid any errors.

In this string

sql = "INSERT INTO Sensors (Timestamp, Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5, Sensor6, Sensor7, Sensor8, Sensor9, Sensor10) VALUES ('" & timestamp & "', " & sensorData(1) & ", " & sensorData(2) & ", " & sensorData(3) & ", " & sensorData(4) & ", " & sensorData(5) & ", " & sensorData(6) & ", " & sensorData(7) & ", " & sensorData(8) & ", " & sensorData(9) & ", " & sensorData(10) & ")"

can you loop it to generate a string?
Yes, you can use a loop to generate the string for the SQL INSERT statement in your VBScript. Here is an example of how you might use a For loop to concatenate the values for the sensor data:

Copy code
dim sql, timestamp, valuesString

' Get current timestamp
timestamp = Now()

' Generate the values string
valuesString = "'" & timestamp & "', "
For i = 1 To 10
    valuesString = valuesString & sensorData(i) & ", "
Next

' Remove the trailing comma and space
valuesString = Left(valuesString, Len(valuesString) - 2)

' Construct SQL INSERT statement
sql = "INSERT INTO Sensors (Timestamp, Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5, Sensor6, Sensor7, Sensor8, Sensor9, Sensor10) VALUES (" & valuesString & ")"
This script first generates a string that contains the timestamp followed by a comma and space, then it uses a For loop to iterate over the sensorData array and add each value along with a comma and space to the string. Finally it remove the trailing comma and space in the valuesString and construct the SQL INSERT statement.

It's a good practice to use a loop to generate the dynamic parts of your SQL statement, also you should use parameters instead of hard-coding values in the SQL statement to avoid SQL Injection and make sure the data type of the variables passed is correct for the SQL statement.
Please remember to check the return value of the execute statement and also do error handling when working with SQL Server and ADODB.

Loop this part also
(Timestamp, Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5, Sensor6, Sensor7, Sensor8, Sensor9, Sensor10)
Yes, you can also use a loop to generate the column names for the SQL INSERT statement. Here is an example of how you might use a For loop to concatenate the column names for the sensor data:

Copy code
dim sql, timestamp, valuesString, columnsString

' Get current timestamp
timestamp = Now()

' Generate the values string
valuesString = "'" & timestamp & "', "
For i = 1 To 10
    valuesString = valuesString & sensorData(i) & ", "
Next

' Remove the trailing comma and space from the values string
valuesString = Left(valuesString, Len(valuesString) - 2)

' Generate the columns string
columnsString = "Timestamp, "
For i = 1 To 10
    columnsString = columnsString & "Sensor" & i & ", "
Next

' Remove the trailing comma and space from the columns string
columnsString = Left(columnsString, Len(columnsString) - 2)

' Construct SQL INSERT statement
sql = "INSERT INTO Sensors (" & columnsString & ") VALUES (" & valuesString & ")"
This script first generates the column names by using a For loop to iterate over the sensor data and adding the column names along with a comma and space to the string and also generate the values string. Then, it removes the trailing comma and space from both strings and finally it constructs the SQL INSERT statement.

It's a good practice to use a loop to generate the dynamic parts of your SQL statement, also you should use parameters instead of hard-coding values in the SQL statement to avoid SQL Injection and make sure the data type of the variables passed is correct for the SQL statement.
Please remember to check the return value of the execute statement and also do error handling when working with SQL Server and ADODB.

How to use VSCode with vbs
To use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with VBScript, you will need to install a VBScript extension for VSCode. There are several VBScript extensions available, but one of the most popular ones is "VBScript" by Microsoft, this extension provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and IntelliSense for VBScript.

Here are the steps to set up VSCode for VBScript development:

Install Visual Studio Code: If you haven't already, you'll need to install VSCode from the official website.

Open Visual Studio Code: Launch VSCode and open the folder that contains your VBScript files.

Install the VBScript extension: In the VSCode editor, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the editor or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on macOS). Once the Extensions pane is open, search for "VBScript" and install the extension.

Open a VBScript file: Open a file that contains VBScript code, and you will notice that VSCode will automatically apply the syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for VBScript

You can also use the VSCode built-in Terminal (Ctrl+ backtick) to run VBScript files, once the file is open, you can press F1 to open the Command Pallete and type "run" to get the "Run on command prompt" option, you will be prompted to choose the file that you want to run, and then you can run the script.

Debugging support for VBScript is not natively built-in into VSCode but you can use an extension like "Script" to have basic debugging support.

You can also customize your VSCode configuration to suit your needs and preferences by going to File -> Preferences -> Settings

Please note that since VBScript is quite old technology and not commonly used, some of the modern features that you are used to in other languages may not be available or may require additional configuration or plugins to work.
It is also recommended to check the official documentation of the VBScript extension and other resources such as the Microsoft docs.

How to run that script
Once you have created and saved your VBScript file in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can run the script in several ways.

One of the easiest ways to run a VBScript file is to use the built-in Terminal in VSCode. You can open the terminal by clicking on the Terminal menu and select New Terminal or by pressing Ctrl+ backtick . Once the terminal is open, navigate to the folder where your script is located, and then run the script by typing cscript <your_script_name>.vbs and press enter.

You can also use the command palette by pressing F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type "Run" in the command palette, this will give you the option to "Run on Command Prompt" and will prompt you to select the file you want to run.

Some of the VBScript Extension provide a command to run the script, you can find it by opening the Command Palette and typing "VBScript: Run"

You can also run the script by double-clicking the .vbs file in Windows explorer, but for this you should set the script interpreter to be WScript or CScript in your script

Please note that you should make sure that the script has no errors and has been saved before running it, also you should be aware of the permissions needed to run the script and the environment you are running it in.

It's a good practice to include error handling in your scripts to handle unexpected errors that may occur when running the script.

I suggest checking the official documentation of VSCode and the VBScript extension for more detailed instructions on how
